## Technical Implementation Details

### NFC Token Format for AWS Auth
```
Chaos Value (4 bytes) + AWS Metadata (8 bytes)
- Bytes 0-3: NESDR entropy-derived chaos value
- Bytes 4-7: Account ID hash
- Bytes 8-11: Role ARN hash + expiration
```

### Authentication Flow Architecture
1. **NFC Scan**: Read chaos value + AWS metadata from tag
2. **Local Validation**: Verify against chaos vault
3. **STS Integration**: Use NFC data to assume AWS IAM role
4. **Credential Generation**: Generate temporary AWS access keys
5. **Session Management**: Re-verify NFC for privileged operations

### Security Considerations
- **Zero Knowledge**: AWS services never see raw NFC data
- **Temporary Credentials**: Short-lived AWS access keys with automatic refresh
- **Hardware Isolation**: NFC processing isolated from AWS communication
- **CloudTrail Integration**: Complete logging of NFC-authenticated AWS operations

---

## AWS-Specific Integration Points

### IAM Role Architecture
```
NFC-Authenticated-Users
â”œâ”€â”€ ReadOnlyAccess (NFC verification level 1)
â”œâ”€â”€ PowerUserAccess (NFC verification level 2)
â””â”€â”€ AdministratorAccess (NFC verification level 3)
```

### STS AssumeRole Flow
1. **NFC Verification**: Validate chaos value against vault
2. **Role Selection**: Map NFC metadata to appropriate IAM role
3. **STS AssumeRole**: Generate temporary credentials for role
4. **Session Token**: Return AWS access keys with session token
5. **Automatic Refresh**: Re-verify NFC before token expiration

### AWS Services Integration Priority
- **High Priority**: IAM, STS, S3, EC2, Lambda
- **Medium Priority**: RDS, CloudFormation, EKS
- **Low Priority**: Specialized services (SageMaker, GameLift, etc.)

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### NFC Chaos Writer Ecosystem
- Leverage existing chaos value generation

## AWS CLI Integration Design

### Custom Credential Provider
```python
# ~/.aws/credentials
[nfc-profile]
credential_source = nfc_chaos_provider
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/NFCAuthenticatedRole
```

### NFC AWS CLI Commands
```bash
# Authenticate via NFC and assume role
aws-nfc assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::account:role/MyRole

# List available NFC-authenticated profiles
aws-nfc list-profiles

# Refresh credentials via NFC re-verification
aws-nfc refresh-credentials
```

- **Mitigation**: Standardized role naming, automated trust relationships

### Security Risks
- **Risk**: Compromise of NFC-to-AWS bridge service
- **Mitigation**: AWS KMS integration, VPC endpoint isolation

- **Risk**: STS token interception in transit
